We have been hard at work, improving the [documentation](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/appdata-guidelines/quality-guidelines) for what we consider good quality app data on Flathub. We have also been working on a new moderation system to help us highlight apps that meet our quality standards.

First, let's be clear, these are not things that will prevent your app from being published on Flathub. We will still accept apps that don't meet these guidelines. However, we will be highlighting apps that do meet them and try to show them in more prominent places on the website.

We've focused on everything, that improves an apps listing on Flathub, this includes the icon, app name and summary. But we saw the need to extend this to the screenshots too.
