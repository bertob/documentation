# Quality guidelines

For the quick guidelines for the actual content (descriptions, screenshots), see the Appstream [docs](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html).

The following guidelines are optional, but recommended. We will likely promote apps that follow them in certain places.
Therefore "must" is used in the following text, but it's not a requirement, it means that apps not following these guidelines will likely not be promoted.

## General

### No trademark violations

Your app should not violate any trademarks. This includes the name, icon, and summary.

For example, if your app is a Telegram client or web wrapper, it should not be called "Telegram for Linux" or use the official Telegram icon. Instead, it should have its own identity (e.g. "Paper Plane", with a custom icon). If it's made clear that it's a third party client it can be ok to mention the original service (e.g. "Tally for Plausible"), but in most cases it should be avoided.

If you're not sure if your app violates any trademarks, feel free to ask us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#flathub:matrix.org).

### Managed by app author

Use Flathub verification to indicate that you are the author of the app and that you are managing the app on Flathub.

## App Icon

### Icon size

The icon should be SVG, or a PNG with a size greater or equal to 256x256px. It has to be square.

### Icon ratio

The icon shouldn't fill too much or too little of the canvas. Avoid filling the entire canvas and having the icon touch the edges of the canvas (except with small protruding elements). Similarly, avoid thin shapes that are hard to see.

### Good contrast

The icon should have good contrast on dark and light backgrounds. In particular, avoid single-color glyphs and the like since they can be very hard to see if the background color is similar. Dark colors near the edges are also a problem, since shadows don't help much with contrast on dark backgrounds.

### Not too much detail

The icon should be recognizable at small sizes. Avoid too many tiny details, small text, and generally try and match other well-executed app icons in terms of complexity.

### No baked-in shadows

The icon should not have any baked-in shadows or glows. Both the Flathub website and native stores apply a shadow to all icons, so baked-in shadows result in double shadows or other glitches.

### In line with contemporary styles

The icon should be somewhat in line with the contemporary icon styles (i.e. not look like it hasn't been updated in decades). The [GNOME](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/guidelines/app-icons.html) and [KDE ](https://develop.kde.org/hig/style/icons/colorful/application/) app icon guidelines are examples of the kind of style your icon should align with.

## App Name

### Not too long

The name should ideally be no longer than 15 characters, and must be shorter than 20 characters.

### Just the name

The name should be just the name, without any additional info. For example, don't append what the app does to the name (e.g. "Apostrophe - Markdown Editor"), and use the summary to provide this extra information instead.

### No weird formatting

The name should not have any weird formatting or punctuation. For example, it should not be all-lowercase, all-uppercase, camel case, or contain dashes or periods. Cases where the weird formatting is part of the brand are exempt from this (e.g. "VLC").

## Summary

### Not too long

The summary should ideally be no longer than 35 characters, and must be shorter than 50 characters.

### Not technical

The summary should be understandable by a non-technical person, and not contain any technical terms (e.g. "Chat app written in Rust and GTK4/Libadwaita"). Don't mention the toolkit, programming language, or other implementation details that would not be relevant to a non-developer and explain what the app does for people instead.

### No weird formatting

The summary should not have any weird formatting or punctuation. It shouldn't end with a full stop.
